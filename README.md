## Releases

Versioning is **per package**, automated with [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please):

- Merging PRs to `main` keeps a rolling **Release PR** per affected package up to date.
- Merging a package's Release PR tags it (`<component>-vX.Y.Z`), publishes a GitHub Release, and publishes to npm/PyPI via OIDC (with provenance) — no manual publish step.

## Contributing

- PRs are **squash-merged**, so the **PR title must be a [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** — e.g. `feat(pi-extension): add X`, `fix(adk-plugin): handle Y`. `feat` → minor, `fix` → patch, `feat!` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` → major; `chore`/`docs`/`ci` → no release.
- Keep each PR scoped to **no more than one package or app** — for packages, release routing is by changed file path, not the scope text.
- Each package/app is self-contained (its own dependency manifest); develop within its folder.

## License

[Apache-2.0](LICENSE), unless a package declares otherwise — each package includes its own `LICENSE`.
